# flutter-shaders
My implementation of the Google Codelab for fragment shaders and particle animations, found [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-next-gen-uis).

### What I learned
- Basics of fragment shaders and particle effects
- The big impact a few small animations can have
- How stacking simple PNGs with color filters creates fascinating scenes

The web version of my implementation is hosted [here](https://extraordinary-strudel-17e64f.netlify.app/#/). Note that the native desktop applications perform significantly better.
